# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）

- Platform Market（特にPCやスマホのOS市場）におけるVertical Integrationの影響について理論的に整理した論文
- Platform MarketはTwo-sided Market（Platformに対してApplication DeveloperとBuyerがいる）であり、ネットワーク効果も加味するとVertical Integrationが経済厚生に与える影響は複雑

## Model

- See Figure 1 in the paper
- In this model, there are four types of players
  1. Platforms compete to license their operating systems to two manufacturers of devices
  2. Manufacturers equip their devices with an operating system, pay some fee to the corresponding platforms, and then compete to sell devices to buyers
  3. Developers pay fees to platforms to publish their applications on the operating systems
  4. Buyers decide which devices to buy, according to prices and applications available on the device
- $N + 1$ (with $N \geq 2$) platforms, denoted by $I, E_{1}, ..., E_{N} \in \mathcal{P}$
- Two manufacturers, denoted by $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$

**Platforms**

- Platforms decide how the benefit from a buyer to share with manufacturers
  - Let $r$ be the per-user benefit generated by a buyer of a device equipped with an operating system
  - $\beta_{i}^{k} \in [0, 1]$ is the share of $r$ benefit kept by manufacturer $k$ (thus the share of the platform is $1 - \beta_{i}^{k}$)
- Platforms also charge fees to application developers
  - Denote by $a_{i}$ the fee charged by platform $i$ to allow a developer to make its application available on that platform’s operating system (can be either positive or negative)
- The profit of a platform $i \in P$ can be expressed as follows:

$$
\Pi_{i} = \sum_{k = 1, 2} \mathbf{1}_{ \{ M_{k} \text{ adopts } i \} } (1 - \beta_{i}^{k})rQ_{B}^{k} + a_{i}q_{i}
$$

**Manufacturers and Buyers**

- The number of buyers of manufacturer $M_{k}$’s device depends on the prices charged by manufacturers to buyers, denoted by $p_{k}$ and $p_{l}$, with $k \neq l \in \{ 1, 2 \}$, and on the number of applications running on the devices, denoted by $n_{S}^{k}$ and $n_{S}^{l}$
- Hence, it may be written as $Q_{B}^{k}(p_{k}, p_{l}, n_{S}^{k}, n_{S}^{l})$.
- The profit of a manufacturer $M_{k}$ when it chooses platform $i$’s operating system can thus be written as follows

$$
\pi_{k} = (p_{k} + \beta_{i}^{k}r)Q_{B}^{k}
$$

- From the buyer side, assume that:
  - devices are demand substitutes for buyers,or $\partial Q_{B}^{k} / \partial p_{k} < 0 < \partial Q_{B}^{k} / \partial p_{l}$
  - the direct price effect is stronger than the indirect one, or $\partial Q_{B}^{k} / \partial p_{k} + \partial Q_{B}^{k} / \partial p_{l} < 0$
  - buyers of device $k$ value positively the number of applications available on their devices, or $\partial Q_{B}^{k} / \partial n_{S}^{k} > 0$, but negatively the number of applications available on the other device, or $\partial Q_{B}^{k} / \partial n_{S}^{l} < 0$ 
- To compute the buyer surplus, we consider that there exists a representative buyer with utility function $U_{B}(q_{1}, q_{2}, n_{S}^{1}, n_{S}^{2})$ such that $Q_{B}^{1}$ and $Q_{B}^{2}$ are solutions of $\max_{(q_{1} \geq 0, q_{2} \geq 0)} U_{B}(q_{1}, q_{2} ,n_{S}^{1}, n_{S}^{2}) − p_{1}q_{1} − p_{2}q_{2}$. 
- Let $V_{B}(p_{1}, p_{2}, n_{S}^{1}, n_{S}^{2})$ denote the corresponding indirect utility
